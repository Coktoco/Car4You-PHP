# Car4You - Vehicle Rental

## Project Description

Car4You is a vehicle rental system that allows users to browse and rent vehicles such as cars, trucks, and boats. The website offers various functionalities, including creating Your own account, searching available vehicles, renting and managing Your current rentals. The main goal of this project was to create a functional web service that was written in pure php without relaying on any framework. This was to practice and further expand my knowledge of basics. 

**Site is available in polish.**
